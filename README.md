# Hotel Management System

In this project, we look at how the hotel management system conducts business and deliver a java desktop application. The project has some requirements:   
* There are three types of accounts: receptionist, guest, and manager.
* The rooms have different styles: standard, deluxe, family, and business.
* Guests can search for available rooms based on their preferred room style, date, and duration of stay.
* Guests can book any available rooms directly from the application.
* When a room is booked, a notification is generated and stored in the system.
* The system maintains a comprehensive database of all room bookings.

More specifically, the following base functions are available to stakeholders/users:
* Register account
* Edit account
* Delete account
* Input the customer data for booking
* Search for available rooms based on room style, date, and duration
* Book available rooms
* Generate booking notifications
* View and manage room bookings
 
The Java OOP programming paradigm is used to design classes. So we apply the principle of OOP such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance. Furthermore, the project is based on three-tier architecture which are presentation, application and data tier.
